# Cisco RIPv2 Troubleshooting - Lab 2

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- The Host IP 1.1.1.1 off Loopback 0 on R1 cannot ping IP 2.2.2.2 off Loopback 0 on R2.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that 1.1.1.1 can ping 2.2.2.2 and network connectivity is restored.

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- After you have Restored the above connectivity from ticket #1, make sure that you can ping Loopback 0 on R4(4.4.4.4) from R1â€™s Loopback 0 interface (1.1.1.1).

### Desired outcome
- You may only modify one line to accomplish this task. Do not delete any configuration in the Routers!
